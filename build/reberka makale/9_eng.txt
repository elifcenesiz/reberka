Steel construction is a widely used building method in many industrial, commercial, and residential projects in Ankara. Steel construction enables the construction of roofs, columns, beams, and other structural elements of buildings using steel materials. This method provides durable, flexible, and lightweight structures and is often preferred for large-span and high-strength buildings.

Projects carried out using steel construction in Ankara may include:

Industrial Facilities: Many industrial facilities in Ankara, such as factories, warehouse facilities, logistics centers, and industrial complexes, are constructed using steel construction. These types of facilities typically require large spans and high ceilings, and steel structures are ideal for meeting these requirements.

Commercial Buildings: Many commercial buildings in Ankara, including office buildings, shopping malls, hotels, and business centers, are constructed using steel construction. Steel structures offer advantages such as rapid assembly, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness, making them attractive for commercial projects.

Bridges and Viaducts: In highway and railway projects in Ankara, the steel construction method is frequently used. In such projects, steel structures reduce costs and shorten construction time by providing lightweight and durable structures.

Sports and Entertainment Facilities: Many stadiums, sports halls, concert halls, and other entertainment facilities in Ankara are constructed using steel construction. Steel structures are ideal for creating large-span areas and offer flexible design options.

Steel construction projects in Ankara are typically carried out by specialized engineering firms or construction companies. These projects encompass the design, manufacturing, assembly, and construction processes of steel materials and are usually conducted in compliance with engineering calculations and standards.
